## I have used whatever technology on this website:
I built the frontend of this website using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Material Tailwind. The backend is powered by Express.js and Node.js, and for the database, I utilized MongoDB. This combination of technologies ensures a robust and dynamic web application with a responsive user interface.

## What is the purpose of the building this website?

This website was created for my personal learning journey, specifically to gain hands-on experience in building an e-commerce type website. The primary goal is to understand the process of developing and deploying a website that facilitates gadget sellers in showcasing and selling their products. Through this project, I aim to enhance my skills in web development and create a valuable platform for gadget sellers.



## 5 Features of my project

- I've successfully implemented data retrieval from the database in my project. The project includes its own server, facilitating the efficient transfer of available data. This setup ensures seamless communication and accessibility of data within the project.
- In my project, when a user adds a product to the cart, the information is persistently stored. Even if the user logs out, they won't lose the data added to the cart. Upon logging in again, users can seamlessly retrieve and view their previously added products in the cart. This feature ensures a continuous and personalized shopping experience for users across sessions.
- I have incorporated animations into my website using the AOS animation pack, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience. Users receive confirmation alerts when adding or updating products. Additionally, to provide a seamless experience, if a user attempts to add the same product multiple times to the cart, a warning alert is triggered, ensuring clarity and preventing unintended actions. These features contribute to a dynamic and user-friendly interface on the website.
- My website is meticulously designed to offer a seamless and engaging experience across various devices. Whether you're accessing it from a mobile phone, tablet, or laptop, our responsive design ensures that the layout and content dynamically adjust to provide optimal viewing and interaction. This feature guarantees that users can enjoy the full functionality and aesthetic appeal of our website, regardless of the device they choose to use
- I've introduced a convenient 'See All' button on every product page, granting users easy access to view an extensive collection of products in one go. By simply clicking the 'See All' button, users can explore and navigate through the entirety of our product catalog, providing a comprehensive and efficient browsing experience. This feature ensures that users can effortlessly access and discover a wide range of offerings with just a single click.
