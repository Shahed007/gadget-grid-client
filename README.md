# About my Project

* I have fetched all the data from database in my project. My project has its own server. Where data is available can be sent.

* In my project, if the user adds any product to the cart, then it will always be there, if the user logs out, he will not be able to see the data added by him. After logging in again, he can see his added products in the cart.

* I product details page, product add page, product update page and cart page are all protected by private route until the user does not login or sign in, he will not be able to go to these pages.

* I have added animation to my website using aos animation pack. If you add more user products, you will get confirmation, if you update, you will get confirmation alert. If you add the same product again and again, you will get a warning even if you go to add cart.

* Make my website fully responsive for mobile, tablet and laptop
